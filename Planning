It is good practice to use self.(variable) as that is how __init__'s initialize variables.

Move hard coded strings outide code.

__init__ is not attached to any function inside of its class. Rather, it executes no
matter what, as long as the class is called, regardless of the function called. Therefore,
no addition code is needed to call the init function.
