REMINDERS:
    It is good practice to use self.(variable) as that is how __init__'s initialize variables.

    Move hard coded strings outide code.

    import (module) will effectively run a module's code by importing it. This is how you can set
    variables using import (method)
    from (module) import (function) will only import a function. Using this, code will not be
    run unlike when you import a module like import (module). You are solely taking the function

    __init__ is not attached to any function inside of its class. Rather, it executes no
    matter what, as long as the class is called, regardless of the function called. Therefore,
    no addition code is needed to call the init function.

    Use continue to move past the iteration if the user inputs something invalid.

    # If you have a bunch of similarly named variable, e.g. slot1, slot2, slot2, try to use a list.
