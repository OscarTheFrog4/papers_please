It is good practice to use self.(variable) as that is how __init__'s initialize variables.

Move hard coded strings outide code.

import (module) will effectively run a module's code by importing it. This is how you can set
variables using import (method)
from (module) import (function) will only import a function. Using this, code will not be
run unlike when you import a module like import (module). You are solely taking the function

__init__ is not attached to any function inside of its class. Rather, it executes no
matter what, as long as the class is called, regardless of the function called. Therefore,
no addition code is needed to call the init function.
